## What is this challenge?

This API accepts a single parameter named url and returns a simple sitemap including the first level links of this url.

## Pre-requisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* [Node.js >= v14](https://nodejs.org/en)
* You can use NPM (included in Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

## First steps

* Clone this repo
* Go to `src` folder.
* Create the `.env` file following the `.env.sample` file.
* Go to root folder.
* Run `./build.sh` script. It'll create the Docker image of the project.

## Running 100% with containers

* Run `./start.sh`.

## Running locally

* Run `./start-local.sh`. It'll only start the Redis container required to run the project.
* Run `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Testing

To run tests (locally), type `npm run test` or `yarn test`

## Kubernetes

I left a `deployment.yaml` as an example to deploy it in K8S.

## Consuming the API

### (GET) /sitemaps/v1/urls

* Returns the sitemap including all the links of a given web page url.
* Requires a url query parameter with a web page url.
* Endpoint example: `localhost:5000/sitemaps/v1/urls?url=https://www.google.com`
* Response example:

```javascript
{
"success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "href": "https://www.google.pt/imghp?hl=pt-PT&tab=wi"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://maps.google.pt/maps?hl=pt-PT&tab=wl"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://play.google.com/?hl=pt-PT&tab=w8"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://www.youtube.com/?gl=PT&tab=w1"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://news.google.com/?tab=wn"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://mail.google.com/mail/?tab=wm"
    },
    {
      "href": "https://drive.google.com/?tab=wo"
    },
  ]
}
```

## About performance

Due to it's assynchronous event-driven and non-blocking architecture, Node.js is definitely one of the best choices to build restfuls API's. Node.js can handle millions of requests assynchonously because each request is stored in a queue and then processed by the event loop assynchronously, giving an amazing performance to our application.

Other choose to increase the performance of this application was using Redis to cache data. If the data is cached, the application doesn't need to make a new HTTP request and parse this HTML to get the links.

Finally, using Docker and Kubernetes allow the application to be containerized and scaled up horizontally, given even more flexibility and power to handle tons of requests simultaneously.
